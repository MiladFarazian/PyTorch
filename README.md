PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

This repository is a collection of python programs that I've started working on
to introduce myself to the world of neural networks and all it has to offer for
the future of my machine learning career
